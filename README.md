## Compilation Instructions

To compile the code, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
g++ code/[filename].cpp code/file_name.cpp -o [output_filename]
```

Replace `[filename]` with the name of the C++ file you wish to compile and `[output_filename]` with the desired name for the compiled executable.

## Running the Program

After compiling the code, you can run the program using the following command:

```bash
./[output_filename] [optional_file_name]
```

- Replace `[output_filename]` with the name you specified during compilation.
- Optionally, you can provide a file name as a command-line argument. If you do not provide a file name, the program will prompt you to enter one. If you enter an empty file name, it will default to using `INPUT_FILE`.

### Example Usage

1. To run the program with a specific input file:
   ```bash
   ./[output_filename] my_input_file
   ```

2. To run the program without a command-line argument (it will prompt for the file name):
   ```bash
   ./[output_filename]
   ```

Make sure that the input file is located in the `input/` directory and has the `.in` extension.
